# Backend Node Express HTTP Server

- To run the backend server first navigate to the **"notts-library-backend"** directory, and then run **"npm run start"** in your terminal, if it's your first time running the app, then you will need to run **"npm install"** first, to install the node modules.
- When the sever connects to the database it will run a check against its ORM model and the tables that are in the database, if no tables are present, it will automatically create the tables for you.
- The API can then be accessed via "**localhost:5000**" in your browser or an HTTP / API client.
