# PostgreSQL Database & PG Admin

- To run the database, first navigate to the **"notts-library-database"** directory, and then run **"docker-compose up"** in your terminal.
- This will start two processes, the first is the database itself, the seccond is a **PGAdmin** instance to access the database via a GUI.
- To access PGAdmin open a browser and go to "**localhost:5050**", then enter the login credentials which can be found in the docker-compose file. You can then register the server within PGAdmin, again the credentials can be found in the docker-compose file.
- If this is the first time you are running the app, there won't be any tables in the database, this is becauase our tables are generated by our backend ORM.
